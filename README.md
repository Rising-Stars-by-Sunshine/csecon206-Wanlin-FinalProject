- **Acknowledgments**: I want to thank Professor Luyao Zhang for her inspiring ideas for classifying game players according to their values and designing the payoff matrix accordingly. Thanks Rong Cong for providing peer evaluation that improves my project a lot. And thanks to everyone in the class for the inspiring discussion.
- **Project Summary**: 
  - In the past, John Nash simplified the love game to a binary choice between "Date" and "Not to Date," proposing that the Nash equilibrium occurred when both players chose "Not to Date." However, this oversimplified model lacks meaningful insights into real-world romantic dynamics. In real life, people do not always make straightforward decisions about whether to date or not. Instead, they often choose to keep things ambiguous, maintaining a level of intimacy that goes beyond friendship but falls short of being in a relationship. Since Nash equilibrium represents a state that no one has anything to gain by changing only one's own strategy, and in reality, people are indeed striving for this kind of optimal state, why does Nash equilibrium fail to predict people's inclinations accurately? This question has inspired the project.
